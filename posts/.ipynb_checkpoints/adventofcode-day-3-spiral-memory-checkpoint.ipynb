    "# Advent of Code Day 3 - Spiral Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "##### AKA. \"I'm afraid we need to use Math!\"<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's (2017/12/03) advent of code puzzle is an interesting one, the first half which can be elegantly solved by applying a little mathematics instead of resorting to brute force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second half has no closed form analytic solution though, so we will have to write an algorithm instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the puzzle we have been given is:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "You come across an experimental new kind of memory stored on an infinite two-dimensional grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked 1 and then counting up while spiraling outward. For example, the first few squares are allocated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    17  16  15  14  13\n",
    "    18   5   4   3  12\n",
    "    19   6   1   2  11\n",
    "    20   7   8   9  10\n",
    "    21  22  23---> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is very space-efficient (no squares are skipped), requested data must be carried back to square 1 (the location of the only access port for this memory system) by programs that can only move up, down, left, or right. They always take the shortest path: the Manhattan Distance between the location of the data and square 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data from square 1 is carried 0 steps, since it's at the access port.\n",
    "    Data from square 12 is carried 3 steps, such as: down, left, left.\n",
    "    Data from square 23 is carried only 2 steps: up twice.\n",
    "    Data from square 1024 must be carried 31 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many steps are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input all the way to the access port?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting little problem which you might have guessed is going to involve square numbers, specifically the squares of all the odd numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split it into two steps, first, given a number, we need to know where it is in the grid.  Then we need to find how far it is from that position back to the position of element 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the position of a given number, lets look at the size of the grid is related to the total number of elements in it. The sizes of the grid increase by two each time, adding a row top and bottom, and left and right, starting from $1\\times1$ to $3\\times3$ to $5\\times5$ and so on. Meanwhile the total number of elements is the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns. So we can see that the total number of elements in grids of increasing size is the sequence of squares of the odd numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "So can we use this to find an expression for which ring of the spiral a number is in? Starting with the $3\\times3$ grid, lets take the square root of all the numbers:"
